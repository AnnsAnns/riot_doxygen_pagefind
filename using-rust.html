<p>On supported CPUs, Rust can be used to develop RIOT applications. Support is indicated in the <code>has_rust_target</code> feature, and tested for in applications using the Makefile line <code>FEATURES_REQUIRED += rust_target</code>.</p>
<p>In addition to the regular RIOT build toolchain and a recent nightly Rust toolchain for the given target, using this also requires C2Rust with some patches applied to be installed; see <a href="#toolchain">toolchain</a> for installation instructions. All these are readily available in the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/riot/riotbuild">official RIOT docker image</a>, which gets used by default if <code>BUILD_IN_DOCKER=1</code> is set.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md2361"></a>
Examples</h1>
<p>Two examples are provided:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="startli"><code>rust-hello-world</code> is minimal in the sense of setup and code complexity; it is the typical Hello World example.</p>
<p class="startli">(Note that it is not necessarily minimal in terms of built size, as Rust's regular printing infrastructure is more powerful and a bit heavier than your off-the-shelf <code>printf</code>, which embedded libcs already often trim down).</p>
</li>
<li><code>rust-gcoap</code> is a set of demo CoAP resources both from the <a href="https://gitlab.com/chrysn/coap-message-demos">coap-message-demos</a> crate (containing platform and library independent examples) and from the <a href="https://gitlab.com/etonomy/riot-module-examples">riot-module-examples</a> crate (containing RIOT specific examples).</li>
</ul>
<p>There are <a href="https://gitlab.com/etonomy/riot-examples/">additional examples</a> available on GitLab, maintained in coordination with the riot-wrappers crate.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md2362"></a>
IDE / editor setup</h1>
<p>Users of Rust often take advantage of autocompletion or inline help. To use this on RIOT projects, some flags and environment variables have to be set, which are listed by <code>make info-rust</code>. These can be configured in the IDE's project setup or exported as environment variables.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md2363"></a>
How it works</h1>
<p>The easy part of the story is that Rust code gets compiled into a static library which is then linked together with the rest of the RIOT code; if the main function happens to be implemented in Rust, so it is.</p>
<p>The <b>RIOT build system</b> contains rules and metadata to facilitate building and linking: it calls <code>cargo</code> (Rust's own build system), sets up paths to work well with out-of-tree builds, configures the Rust target depending on the board's CPU, and unpacks the static library into object files to facilitate interaction with XFA.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://crates.io/crates/riot-sys"><b>riot-sys</b></a> crate translates a selected subset of RIOT's header files for use in Rust; this happens both using the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/bindgen">bindgen</a> crate (working from API information in header files) and <a href="https://c2rust.com/">C2Rust</a> (translating static inline functions, and with some help from riot-sys, constant preprocessor initializers). Functions exported by riot-sys are inherently unsafe to use (in Rust's sense of unsafe), and may be somewhat volatile in their API due to mismatches between RIOT's / C's and Rust's API stability concepts.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://crates.io/crates/riot-wrappers"><b>riot-wrappers</b></a> crate creates safe and idiomatic wrappers around the types and functions provided by riot-sys. Thanks to Rust's strong zero-cost abstractions, these often come at no increased runtime cost. For example, locking a <a href="https://rustdoc.etonomy.org/riot_wrappers/mutex/struct.Mutex.html">riot_wrappers::mutex::Mutex</a> can rely on it having been properly initialized at creation; furthermore, the mutex is freed when it goes out of scope.</p>
<p>Where practical, the wrappers are not accessed through own methods but through established platform independent traits. For example, the main API surface of an <a href="https://rustdoc.etonomy.org/riot_wrappers/i2c/struct.I2CDevice.html">I2CDevice</a> is its implementation of the <a href="https://rustdoc.etonomy.org/embedded_hal/blocking/i2c/index.html">corresponding embedded-hal I2C traits</a> for reading and writing.</p>
<p>The wrappers are <a href="https://rustdoc.etonomy.org/">documented together with riot-sys and some of the examples</a>.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md2364"></a>
Library components in Rust</h1>
<p>It is possible to use Rust in different modules than the application itself.</p>
<p>Such modules are usually pseudomodules (although they may be mixed with C in regular modules as well). They always depend on the <code>rust_riotmodules</code> module / crate, which collects all enabled modules into a single crate by means of optional features.</p>
<p>If the application is not written in Rust, that then depends on <code>rust_riotmodules_standalone</code>, which adds a panic handler and serves as a root crate.</p>
<p>If the application is written in Rust, <code>rust_riotmodules</code> needs to be added as a dependency of the application. (This helps deduplicate between application and library code, and also avoids symbol name clashes). This is done by adding a dependency on the local <code>rust_riotmodules</code> crate (which is a no-op when no such modules are enabled), and placing an <code>extern crate rust_riotmodules;</code> statement in the code. (The latter is needed even after most <code>extern crate</code> was abolished in 2018, because crates depended on but not used otherwise are usually not linked in).</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="toolchain"></a>
Toolchain</h1>
<p>To install the necessary Rust components, it is easiest use <a href="https://rustup.rs/"><b>rustup</b>, installed as described on its website</a>.</p>
<p>Using Rust on RIOT needs the latest stable version of Rust.</p>
<p>Make sure you have the core library for the CPU (<b>target</b>) of your choice available:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">$ rustup target add thumbv7m-none-eabi</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>Substitute thumbv7m-none-eabi with the value of <code>RUST_TARGET</code> in the output of <code>make info-build</code> of an application that has your current board selected (or just add it later whenever the Rust compiler complains about not finding the core library for a given target). Using the beta or nightly toolchains will work just as well if they are selected through rustup's override mechanism.</p>
<p>While Rust comes with its own <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/">cargo</a> dependency tracker for any Rust code, it does not attempt to install <b>system components</b>. To avoid playing the whack-a-mole of installing components whenever an install step fails, consider installing this list of packages on Debian (or an equivalent list on the distribution of your choice):</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"># apt install libclang-dev llvm llvm-dev cmake libssl-dev pkg-config</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>This encompass both components needed for riot-sys and for the later installation of C2Rust.</p>
<p>In addition to the Rust compiler you'll need to install the C2Rust transpiler; as this is using some recent fixes, it is best installed as:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">$ cargo install c2rust --git https://github.com/immunant/c2rust --tag v0.19.0</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>If multiple versions of LLVM are installed locally, it may be necessary to prefix it with the selected LLVM version:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">$ LLVM_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/bin/llvm-config-16 cargo install …</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md2365"></a>
Maintenance</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/RIOT-OS/rust-riot-sys/">riot-sys</a> and <a href="https://github.com/RIOT-OS/rust-riot-wrappers/">riot-wrappers</a> crates are currently maintained as parts of the RIOT project. While being released via crates.io on demand, usually RIOT uses a fixed version from the git repositories that are <a href="https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/17491#issuecomment-1143209437">easily updated</a>.</p>
<p>The autogenerated bindings of the C API are slightly stricter than C's API, and thus occasionally require additional work when C APIs change subtly. The riot-sys crate takes the brunt of these changes &ndash; it changes automatically, and no attempt is currently made to reflect these changes in a SemVer compatible manner. The riot-wrappers crate smooths this out, and provides an API that aims to be more stable than the C API. It does that by generously converting types that changed, and <a href="https://github.com/RIOT-OS/rust-riot-wrappers/blob/db9d163e3eddcb7154edcf25db7207e4123964ee/src/helpers.rs#L3">introspecting generated bindings</a> or using <a href="https://github.com/RIOT-OS/rust-riot-sys/blob/525b2384a3541d4879a5f3845ee6241243c29a78/build.rs#L591">information provided by riot-sys</a>.</p>
<p>The typical workflow of (C-nonbreaking, Rust-breaking) API changes is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="startli">A PR subtly alters a type (eg. <code>uint8_t *</code> to <code>void *</code> in <a href="https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/17990">#17990</a>).</p>
<p class="startli">Consequently, builds of Rust examples break.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">A PR is opened on riot-wrappers to smooth over the change, like <a href="https://github.com/RIOT-OS/rust-riot-wrappers/commit/aab605f464a279608ef0a8ad2afd5ae43179e330">aab605f4</a> .</p>
<p class="startli">The PR is tested against current master in its CI (albeit not for the full set of boards). To test whether it also works for the changed API, a commit titled "REMOVEME Test with updated riot-wrappes" can be added to the original PR; it alters <code>.cargo/config.toml</code> to point to the changed branch, and removes any Cargo.lock files in the RIOT tree.</p>
<p class="startli">That PR is then merged.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">The version of riot-wrappers that works both with the previous and the new code is pulled into the RIOT master branch by updating the Cargo.lock files. The PR can look like <a href="https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/18181">#18181</a>, and verifies that the new riot-wrappers works on all boards.</p>
<p class="startli">That PR is then merged.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">For the next builds (up to the merging of) the original PR, the REMOVEME commit can be removed.</p>
<p class="startli">It is good practice to rebase it onto the latest master after the update to riot-wrappers has been merged, as this helps keeping bisectability up.</p>
<p class="startli">The PR now contains no Rust specific changes, and can be merged.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few variations that can occur:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes casting is not enough, and a type must be extracted from a signature. <a href="https://github.com/RIOT-OS/rust-riot-wrappers/pull/6/files#diff-ccb7946e3b4122ea3ce23fa9bc54eba63d75f7a6142fd4afdd9908b1bead50e0">See the phydat callback type change</a> for an example.</li>
<li><p class="startli">When neither casting nor type detection is sufficient, a marker can be introduced through riot-sys; it detects a keyword's presence in the source and passes it as <a href="https://github.com/RIOT-OS/rust-riot-sys/blob/525b2384a3541d4879a5f3845ee6241243c29a78/build.rs#L591">information provided by riot-sys</a> to riot-wrappers. <a href="https://github.com/RIOT-OS/rust-riot-wrappers/pull/4/files">See the coap_request_ctx_t change</a> for an example.</p>
<p class="startli">In that case, a riot-sys PR is opened in parallel to the riot-wrappers PR.</p>
<p class="startli">This method helps keeping changes backportable easily: riot-sys and riot-wrappers are expected to work with the latest released version of RIOT all the time, and avoid flag-day changes. (Keeping riot-sys and riot-wrappers compatible with the latest release is also important to retain the ability to backport fixes).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">When functions are moved from being static and not being static, their names go from <code>riot_sys::inline::name</code> to <code>riot_sys::name</code> (or vice versa).</p>
<p class="startli">riot-sys <a href="https://github.com/RIOT-OS/rust-riot-sys/blob/525b2384a3541d4879a5f3845ee6241243c29a78/build.rs#L533">has a list</a> of items that are always publicly exported directly as <code>riot_sys::name</code>; just add the function there.</p>
<p class="startli">If non-generic types are referenced in them, they go from <code>riot_sys::inline::my_type_t</code> to <code>riot_sys::my_type_t</code>. The <a href="https://github.com/RIOT-OS/rust-riot-wrappers/blob/db9d163e3eddcb7154edcf25db7207e4123964ee/src/lib.rs#L68">inline_cast</a> function family helps making that cast a bit safer.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Things fail around atomics.</p>
<p class="startli">Until <a href="https://github.com/immunant/c2rust/issues/436">C2Rust's support for atomics has improved</a>, riot-sys requires all exported headers to use the better supported <code><a class="el" href="atomic__utils_8h.html" title="API of the utility functions for atomic accesses.">atomic_utils.h</a></code>.</p>
<p class="startli">If it is unavoidable that atomics are part of header files (and not actually used in any static inline functions), riot-sys's <a href="https://github.com/RIOT-OS/rust-riot-sys/blob/525b2384a3541d4879a5f3845ee6241243c29a78/riot-c2rust.h#L79">atomics workarounds</a> can be extended as a last resort. </p>
